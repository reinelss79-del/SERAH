                garden, my cooling water, my soul’s life, the owner of my longing, the cure for my wounds,
                the soother of my heart, the light of my path, my soul mate, the guardian of my heart, the
                reason for my smile, the owner of my beating heart, the tune in my song, my beautiful
                dream, my night guard, the soother of my soul, the lamp in my darkness, the crashing of my
                waves, my morning sun, my gentle breeze, the refreshing rain, the calming dusk, the dew on
                the leaves, the sun of life, the poetry in my heart, the eternal story, the harmony of my soul,
                the endless longing, my complement, my final destination, my life’s inspiration, the melody
                of my tune, my warmest hug, the smile I long for, my little heaven, the guardian of my
                dreams, the light of my stars, my breath, the sigh of my longing, the beat of my heart, my
                most beautiful night, the hope in my life, the dawn of my salvation, my bright afternoon, my
                calm waves, my shield of my heart, my love ark, my night blanket, my morning embrace, my
                universe harmony, my heart’s idol, the flower sower on my path, my love lantern, the
                morning star in my darkness, the oxygen in my breath, my ocean of love, my living soul, the
                aurora of my love, the inspiration of my longing, the solace of my fatigue, my limitless
                happiness, and the eternal time in my life.</p>
